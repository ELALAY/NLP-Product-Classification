determine your eye shape. If eyes are close-set or round, line only the 

outer corners. Otherwise, line the entire upper lid.Gently pull your eyelid taut at an upward angle. Beginning at the inner 

corner, draw small, connected dashes along the top lashes. Be sure to 

stay close to the roots so there is no skin visible between the lashes 

and the liner. To make eyes look bigger, extend the liner slightly 

beyond the outer corners.Use a cotton swab to fix mistakes. For larger messes, dip it in makeup remover."
